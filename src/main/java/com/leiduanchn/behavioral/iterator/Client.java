/**
 * The iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
 *
 * 1. Here we have a common interface Aggregate for client as it decouples it from the implementation of your collection of objects.
 * 2. The ConcreteAggregate implements createIterator() that returns iterator for its collection. Each ConcreteAggregateâ€™s responsibility is to instantiate a ConcreteIterator
 *      that can iterate over its collection of objects.
 * 3. The iterator interface provides a set of methods for traversing or modifying the collection that is in addition to next()/hasNext()
 *      it can also provide functions for search, remove etc.
